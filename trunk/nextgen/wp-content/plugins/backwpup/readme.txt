== Installation ==

1. Download BackWPup Plugin.
1. Decompress and upload the contents of the archive into /wp-content/plugins/.
1. Activate the Plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Requires =
* PHP 5.2.0
* WordPress 2.8, works best with 3.1
* curl (for Amazon S3, MS Azur, RackSpace, Dropbox Support)
* gzip (for PCLZIP and gzip archives)
* bzip2 (for bzip2 archives)

= Where is the Database dump File? =
in the root folder of the archive. <i>DBName</i>.sql

= Where is the WordPress Export File? =
in the root folder of the archive. <i>blogname</i>.wordpress.<i>jjjj-mm-dd</i>.xml

= Zip File Support =
Plugin uses zip extension if PHP, if not, uses PCLZIP lib extension

= Maintenance Mode =
Supported Plugins
* maintenance-mode
* wp-maintenance-mode
* WordPress .maintenance file

If your site does not come back from Maintenance Mode, switch back from Maintenance Mode by changing the Plugin options or delete the <i>.maintenance</i> file in the install's root folder.

= Restore a Blog Database =
Copy the <i>DBName</i>.sql in the root folder of the site and go to the tools tab in the Plugin.
You can also use PHPMyAdmin.

= Abnormal Script Cancellations =
Webserver normally aborts scripts that works longer then 300s.
PHP normally aborts scripts that works longer then 30s but the plugin will try to keep this from happening.

= Memory usage =
* The plugin is coded to use low memory
* The plugin will try to increase memory automatically if needed
* PCLZIP lib needs 8MB free memory for zipping
* Emailing an archive needs a lot of memory

= Email archives =
I have built in many options to optimize email archives, but the mailing library uses a lot of memory.
You should only send small archives via email.

= FTP Warnings =
Please deactivate passive mode and try it again.

= Disable some destinations for backups =
You can set the following in wp-config.php:
<i>define('BACKWPUP_DESTS','S3,RSC,FTP,DROPBOX,MSAZURE,SUGARSYNC');</i>
all listed destinations are then disabled.
Destinations are:
* MAIL = mail (can't disable)
* DIR = Directory (can't disable)
* S3 = Amazon S3
* RSC = RackSpaceCloud
* FTP = FTP Server
* DROPBOX = DropBox
* MSAZURE = Microsoft Azure (Blob)
* SUGARSYNC = SugarSync
